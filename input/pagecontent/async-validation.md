This page describes a **FHIR-native submission channel** for the clinical cancer
registration (Stream 1 on the [Data flow](dataflow.html) page). Instead of manual
web entry or HIS batch extraction through WBCR, a hospital system submits the
completed registration form to a national FHIR server, which validates it
**asynchronously** and reports the result back on a FHIR `Task`.

> This is a forward-looking design proposal. It is **draft** and must be
> confirmed with BCR before any production use.

### What this flow does

1. The hospital posts a **Condition** (the cancer case) to the national FHIR server. The server creates the registration **Task** ([BCRRegistrationTask](StructureDefinition-bcr-registration-task.html)) from it — `status = ready` — to track the obligation to register the case; its `focus` points back at the Condition.
2. The coordinating physician completes the cancer registration **Questionnaire**, producing a **QuestionnaireResponse**.
3. The hospital submits the QuestionnaireResponse to the national FHIR server, which creates a per-attempt **validation Task** ([BCRValidationTask](StructureDefinition-bcr-validation-task.html)) declaring whether this is a **partial** or **final** submission. The first submission moves the registration Task to `in-progress`.
4. Validation runs in a **background process**. When it finishes, the result is attached to `Task.output` as an [OperationOutcome](StructureDefinition-bcr-validation-outcome.html), and the validation Task's `status` is set to `completed` or `failed`.
5. The hospital is notified of the result through a **Subscription** (or by polling). After a successful **final** submission, either the registry or the hospital may close the registration Task (`completed`).

### Actors

| Actor | Role |
|---|---|
| Coordinating physician / HIS | Completes the form, submits, corrects and resubmits. |
| Belgian Cancer Registry | Imposes the registration obligation; requester of the registration Task. |
| National FHIR validation service | Receives submissions, runs background validation, owns the validation Task. |

### Design principle: Task status moves *forward only*

A submission that can fail and be resubmitted looks, at first glance, like it
needs a `Task` whose status cycles back to an earlier state. It does not — and
the FHIR community is consistent that it should not. The Task state machine in
the [specification](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/task.html#statemachine) is
illustrative and effectively forward-only: once a Task reaches a terminal state
(`completed`, `failed`, `cancelled`, `rejected`), it stays there. The idiomatic
way to "go back and redo" is a **new Task**, not a rewound status.

Two status axes are kept separate:

- **`QuestionnaireResponse.status`** — state of the *form data*. This first version does **not** rely on it (in particular it does not use `amended`): a correction is simply a new submission with a fresh `BCRValidationTask`.
- **`Task.status`** — state of the *validation/registration workflow*.

And the workflow is split into **two Tasks** so neither one ever has to move backwards:

```mermaid
flowchart BT
    C["<b>Condition</b><br/>the cancer case"]
    R["<b>BCRRegistrationTask</b><br/>registration obligation · long-lived"]
    V1["<b>BCRValidationTask</b><br/>attempt 1 — failed"]
    V2["<b>BCRValidationTask</b><br/>attempt 2 — completed"]

    V1 -->|partOf| R
    V2 -->|partOf| R

    click R "StructureDefinition-bcr-registration-task.html" "BCRRegistrationTask profile" _blank
    click V1 "Task-ExampleBCRValidationTaskFailed.html" "Failed attempt (example)" _blank
    click V2 "Task-ExampleBCRValidationTaskAccepted.html" "Accepted attempt (example)" _blank

    classDef case fill:#fef3c7,stroke:#d97706,color:#7c2d12;
    classDef parent fill:#eef2ff,stroke:#4f46e5,stroke-width:2px,color:#1e1b4b;
    classDef attempt fill:#f0fdf4,stroke:#16a34a,color:#14532d;
    class C case
    class R parent
    class V1,V2 attempt
```

Read the arrows as the FHIR reference: `BCRRegistrationTask.focus → Condition`
(the case the obligation is about) and `BCRValidationTask.partOf →
BCRRegistrationTask`. Each validation attempt is a **sub-task *of*** the single
registration obligation — not the reverse.

All of the back-and-forth of repeated attempts lives in the registration Task's
**`businessStatus`** (`correction-required`) and in the **history of validation
Tasks** — never in a backwards `status` transition. This also preserves a
complete audit trail (attempt 1 failed, attempt 2 accepted), which matters for a
legally mandated registry.

    end
```

### State transition models

Each Task type has its own state machine. The registration obligation carries
**two independent axes** — a forward-only `status` and a free-moving
`businessStatus` — while each validation attempt has a single `status`.

**`BCRRegistrationTask.status`** — forward-only; never rewinds:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    direction LR
    state "ready" as ready
    state "in-progress" as inprogress
    state "completed" as completed
    state "cancelled / failed" as terminal
    [*] --> ready: BCR creates Task from Condition
    ready --> inprogress: first QuestionnaireResponse submitted
    inprogress --> completed: successful final validation (registry or hospital)
    ready --> terminal: withdrawn / error
    inprogress --> terminal: withdrawn / error
    completed --> [*]
    terminal --> [*]
```

**`BCRRegistrationTask.businessStatus`** — the deliberately *cyclic* axis where
the back-and-forth of repeated attempts (and post-completion corrections) lives:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    direction LR
    state "awaiting-data" as awaiting
    state "under-validation" as validating
    state "correction-required" as correction
    state "partially-accepted" as partial
    state "accepted" as accepted
    state "withdrawn" as withdrawn
    [*] --> awaiting: Task created
    awaiting --> validating: submission received
    validating --> correction: validation failed
    validating --> partial: partial submission passed
    validating --> accepted: final submission passed
    correction --> validating: resubmission
    partial --> validating: next submission
    accepted --> correction: correction after completion
    awaiting --> withdrawn: submitter withdraws
    partial --> withdrawn: submitter withdraws
    accepted --> [*]
    withdrawn --> [*]
```

**`BCRValidationTask.status`** — one short-lived machine per submission attempt:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    direction LR
    state "in-progress" as inprogress
    [*] --> requested
    requested --> received
    received --> accepted
    accepted --> inprogress
    inprogress --> completed: validation passed
    inprogress --> failed: blocking errors
    completed --> [*]
    failed --> [*]
```

### Status & output mapping

| Stage / result | `BCRValidationTask.status` | `BCRRegistrationTask.status` | `BCRRegistrationTask.businessStatus` | `Task.output` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Case opened (Condition posted) | — | `ready` | `awaiting-data` | — |
| Queued at server | `received` / `accepted` | `in-progress` | `submitted` | — |
| Validating | `in-progress` | `in-progress` | `under-validation` | — |
| Valid, **partial** submission | `completed` | `in-progress` | `partially-accepted` | OperationOutcome (information) |
| Valid, **final** submission | `completed` | `completed` | `accepted` | OperationOutcome (information) + registration-id |
| Valid, warnings only (final) | `completed` | `completed` | `accepted-with-warnings` | OperationOutcome (warning) + registration-id |
| Invalid (blocking errors) | `failed` | `in-progress` | `correction-required` | OperationOutcome (error) |
| System/processing error | `failed` | `in-progress` | `correction-required` | OperationOutcome (exception) |
| Correction after completion | `completed` / `failed` | `completed` (unchanged) | `correction-required` → `accepted` | OperationOutcome (as above) |

**R4 note:** `Task.statusReason` is a `CodeableConcept` in R4 (it only became a
`CodeableReference` in R5), so it carries a [coded reason](CodeSystem-bcr-task-status-reason.html)
while the human-readable detail lives in the `OperationOutcome` referenced from
`Task.output`.

### Submitting

The registration Task already exists (the server created it from the posted
`Condition`), so each form submission just references it via `partOf`. The
hospital submits the validation Task and the QuestionnaireResponse atomically
as a **transaction Bundle** to the national server. Each validation Task declares
its `submission-intent` (`partial` or `final`):

```json
{
  "resourceType": "Bundle",
  "type": "transaction",
  "entry": [
    {
      "fullUrl": "urn:uuid:qr-1",
      "resource": { "resourceType": "QuestionnaireResponse", "status": "completed", "...": "..." },
      "request": { "method": "POST", "url": "QuestionnaireResponse" }
    },
    {
      "fullUrl": "urn:uuid:task-v-1",
      "resource": {
        "resourceType": "Task",
        "meta": { "profile": ["https://www.ehealth.fgov.be/standards/fhir/registries/bcr/StructureDefinition/bcr-validation-task"] },
        "status": "requested",
        "intent": "order",
        "code": { "coding": [{ "system": "https://www.ehealth.fgov.be/standards/fhir/registries/bcr/CodeSystem/bcr-task-code", "code": "validate-submission" }] },
        "partOf": [{ "reference": "Task/registration-task-1" }],
        "focus": { "reference": "urn:uuid:qr-1" },
        "input": [
          {
            "type": { "coding": [{ "system": "https://www.ehealth.fgov.be/standards/fhir/registries/bcr/CodeSystem/bcr-task-io", "code": "questionnaire-response" }] },
            "valueReference": { "reference": "urn:uuid:qr-1" }
          },
          {
            "type": { "coding": [{ "system": "https://www.ehealth.fgov.be/standards/fhir/registries/bcr/CodeSystem/bcr-task-io", "code": "submission-intent" }] },
            "valueCodeableConcept": { "coding": [{ "system": "https://www.ehealth.fgov.be/standards/fhir/registries/bcr/CodeSystem/bcr-submission-intent", "code": "final" }] }
          }
        ]
      },
      "request": { "method": "POST", "url": "Task" }
    }
  ]
}
```

The created validation `Task` **is** the durable async job handle — validation
itself happens in the background, so the server can return immediately with the
Task in `received`/`accepted`. (The synchronous `$validate` operation is *not*
appropriate here: it is structural and blocking, whereas this validation is
asynchronous and applies cross-field oncology business rules.)

### Getting the result — Subscription

The hospital is notified when a validation attempt reaches a terminal state. The
example uses a classic R4 rest-hook [Subscription](Subscription-ExampleBCRValidationSubscription.html):

```
criteria: Task?part-of=Task/<registration-task>&status=completed,failed
channel:  rest-hook  →  https://his.hospital-x.example/fhir/bcr/validation-callback
```

On notification the hospital reads the validation Task and its `output`
OperationOutcome; on failure it shows the issues (each `issue.expression` is a
FHIRPath into the submitted QuestionnaireResponse, so the UI can point the user
at the exact field), the physician corrects the form, and a new validation Task
is submitted.

Two resources are worth watching, and the hospital can use a Subscription **or**
polling for either:

- the **validation Task** — the per-attempt result (`completed` / `failed`), as above;
- the **registration Task** — its `businessStatus` changes (e.g. `partially-accepted`, `correction-required`) and its eventual closure (`status = completed`). Watch it with a second Subscription (`criteria: Task/<registration-task>`) or by polling `GET Task/<registration-task>`.

Alternatives: **polling** `GET Task/<id>` until terminal; or, for production
robustness, **topic-based subscriptions** via the [Subscriptions R5 Backport](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/subscriptions-backport/)
IG (would add a `SubscriptionTopic` and a dependency — out of scope for this
draft).

### Worked example

A complete, resolvable example graph — attempt 1 fails on a missing topography,
the physician corrects, attempt 2 is accepted:

- Cancer case: [ExampleBCRCancerCondition](Condition-ExampleBCRCancerCondition.html) (the `Condition` the registration Task focuses on)
- Registration obligation: [ExampleBCRRegistrationTask](Task-ExampleBCRRegistrationTask.html) (`correction-required` mid-flow)
- Attempt 1 (failed): [ExampleBCRValidationTaskFailed](Task-ExampleBCRValidationTaskFailed.html) → [outcome](OperationOutcome-ExampleBCRValidationOutcomeFailed.html)
- Attempt 2 (accepted): [ExampleBCRValidationTaskAccepted](Task-ExampleBCRValidationTaskAccepted.html) → [outcome](OperationOutcome-ExampleBCRValidationOutcomeAccepted.html)
- Submitted form: [ExampleBCRSubmittedQuestionnaireResponse](QuestionnaireResponse-ExampleBCRSubmittedQuestionnaireResponse.html)
- Notification: [ExampleBCRValidationSubscription](Subscription-ExampleBCRValidationSubscription.html)
